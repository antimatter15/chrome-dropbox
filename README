THIS PROJECT IS OBSOLETE

Based on https://github.com/kenotron/chromepad (that is, before it became https://github.com/kenotron/sourcekit ) but actually works

I think the dropbox stuff inside sourcekit does in fact work now, so this project is pretty much useless.

It was made for my drag2up project which has some different code (maybe, not sure). But either way, sourcekit for the win. However. There's one notable thing that whoever is implementing dropbox in javascript for chrome should be aware of: Binary Data.

If you're going to be uploading binary data to dropbox, you cant use the libraries unmodified. drag2up's files.js and hacked modern_dropbox.js demonstrate the only known way to upload binary string data using multipart/form-data. For most purposes, I'm sure using the new FormData() could be used as well, but in order to upload a binary string, one must have Chrome 9 or higher, so the WebGL Typed Arrays spec and BlobBuilder can be used to construct post data for upload. Otherwise, Chrome automatically makes UTF-8 encoded data. Not good.
